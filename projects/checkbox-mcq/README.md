# ngx-google-forms-checkbox-mcq

Create a reusable UI library that behaves like:
- a MCQ (multiple-choice-question) with checkboxes that allows for more than one right answer
- or, a poll with checkboxes that allows for more than one choice to be selected

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project checkbox-mcq` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project checkbox-mcq`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project checkbox-mcq` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

1. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

    ```
    npm run build_checkbox_mcq
    npm run pack_checkbox_mcq
    ```

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build checkbox-mcq`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/checkbox-mcq` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test checkbox-mcq` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
